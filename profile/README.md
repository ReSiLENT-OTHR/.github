## A resilient, safe and secure charging infrastructure

ReSiLENT creates a resilient charging infrastructure for cost-effective operation in which 
cyber security can be guaranteed over the life cycle. To this end, ReSiLENT is developing a
novel approach that allows cybersecurity information and assets to be rolled out across 
actors and elements of a networked charging infrastructure via peer-to-peer protocols. 
This establishes a resilient cybersecurity mesh architecture in which contextual information
on security incidents is automatically exchanged between elements, devices and actors within
the charging infrastructure.
